PapaPan is a cross-platform auto-panning audio plugin built with JUCE.
It works in VST3, AU, and Standalone formats and lets you move sound smoothly between the left and right channels in several modulation modes.


âœ¨ Features

* Automatic panning with adjustable rate, depth, and waveform.
* Five modulation modes for different sync behaviors.
* Tempo and beat synchronization with the host DAW.
* Real-time modulation visualization.
* Lightweight DSP optimized for real-time use.

ðŸ§­ Modulation Modes
* **Hertz Retrig**.

Pans the signal at a fixed frequency (Hz).
The phase resets every time playback starts.

* **Beat Retrig.**

Panning speed follows the project tempo (BPM) and a chosen musical duration.
The phase resets on playback start.

* **Hertz Synced**

Like Hertz Retrig., but the phase doesnâ€™t reset â€” it continues smoothly from the current time, keeping motion continuous.

* **Beat Synced**

Tempo-synchronized panning where phase is recalculated based on the DAW playhead position.
When the play cursor is moved, the panning stays in sync with the beat.

* **Pitch â†’ Rate**

The panning rate depends on the detected pitch (F0) of the input signal â€” higher notes move faster across the stereo field.
